# Data Plot and Interpretation

The chart indicates that from 2006 to 2013, beer consumption in the Netherlands remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 11.4 - 11.5 million hectoliters.

However, from 2014 to the latest data in 2018, there has been an exponential increase, with beer consumption reaching a maximum of over 12 million hectoliters in 2018.

It is difficult and ambiguous to make further comments on the visual results, since further conclusions require additional information, such as population cencus data, tourist arrival statistics for the Netherlands and so on.
